# StudentHousingFinder

## Project 2:

An application that lets users explore a list of student housing.

It will support:

- CRUD dorm/apartment listings
- Sort alphabetically and filter by location/building, cost, or by user input
- Owner/renter (user) sign-up/login
- CRUD user information
- Users can rate dorm/apartment listings
- Monthly/annual statistics for owners/renters
- Favorites for users

## Installation and Execution

1. Clone the repository
2. In terminal: `npm install`
3. In terminal: `npm start`
4. In browser, go to http://localhost:3000/

<!-- > _Register and Sign In Note:
> Because owners and students have different permissions for listings, page will look different depending on whether you sign up as an owner or a student._ -->
